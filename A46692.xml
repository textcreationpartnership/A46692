            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Haſt thou never felt her <hi>Mad Blood</hi> frolicking in thine own Veins, and the <hi>Diſtemper</hi> gotten up into thy <hi>Head</hi> too? How often have the <hi>Felicities</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> been preſented by Pride upon the <hi>Stage</hi> of thy Fancy? And how brave it would be to drink thy fill of <hi>Nectar</hi> with the Gods?

What maketh thee judge of the earneſt <hi>Purſuits</hi> of a few here and there after an Inviſible Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to be perfect <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and breach of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; and haſt wondred they ſhould look after another Heaven than that thou enjoyeſt already on Earth?

A perfect Stranger to that <hi>Faith</hi> that is the <hi>Evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> Alas Man! as a dangerous Frantick thou art cloſe ſhut up in the Dungeon of Unbelief; where thy Brain works upon a thouſand <hi>Chimera</hi>'s, which evaporate all into Air and Nothing!</p>
                           <p>Come, let us lay theſe things to Heart: Is it nothing to thee, that the ſame Pride which firſt

Thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath forewarned thee of the killing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them, that are all bred in the <hi>Heart,</hi> Mat. 15.18. <hi>Out of the heart proceed,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>Who is ignorant that they watch all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Advantages to deſtroy us, and cloſe

                           <p>And God knows this is ſo frequent a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in the World, that it has loſt its Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Wonder, ſince it is become but a piece of Honour and Good Nature to commiſerate the <hi>Fiends,</hi> and in Civility to give them our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into <hi>Torment,</hi> while they by the Noiſe of <hi>Huzza's</hi> and Jollities ſo deafen our Ears from the Cries of the tormented Conſcience or Reaſon, that we are content to be <hi>Sacrific'd</hi> in a Frolick with them, and ſcorn to preſent any cheaper ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their <hi>Muſick,</hi> than the noble Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a <hi>Soul</hi> unto <hi>Molock;</hi> while yet the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a God, and Tears of Blood ſtreaming from his very heart, have not the leaſt Intereſt or Influence at all to reſtrain us from that mad <hi>Sally</hi> into Eternal <hi>Flames.</hi>

In all theſe Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe promiſes her utmoſt skill to aſſiſt them.</p>
                           <p>Now for the manner of their <hi>Eating;</hi> this above all hath given her the greateſt Affliction: As if God had ſtill left them under the Curſe of <hi>Temperance,</hi> and given them nothing but <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Sallads</hi> to feed on: She verily thinks their Fields and Meadows did not preſent their Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Iſſues to a more ſilly and dull-brain'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World. What, had they not learned the ſacred Science of <hi>Eating Well?</hi> Unskilful yet in the Lectures of <hi>Cookery</hi> and <hi>Sauces?</hi> Nor how to Exerciſe the <hi>Trained-Bands</hi> of Diſhes and Platters? She hates to ſee them gnawing upon thoſe tougher <hi>Bits,</hi> which tormented them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Fret</hi> of a tedious Digeſtion: Had their <hi>Women</hi> no <hi>Alimbecks</hi> to bleſs them into the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of the <hi>Quinteſſence?</hi> Had they never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd an <hi>Oxe</hi> into a Meſs of <hi>Jelly?</hi> And what were ſo many <hi>Flocks</hi> given them, but to Elixirate all into <hi>Broth,</hi> whoſe ſubtile vertue they ſhould find frolicking in their capering Veins?</p>
                           <p>And as to <hi>Drinks;</hi> ſhe fears the Vicinity of their Streams had but bewitched them into the Judgment of too frequent <hi>Draughts</hi> from them: Or if they were arriv'd at the knack of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103999:66"/>them a little, by a ſmall Infuſion of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of their <hi>Acres</hi> with them, this ſhe believes is their extreameſt Happineſs, when now ſhe was come to acquaint them, That the Jolly <hi>Grape</hi> was proud to ſhed his <hi>Blood</hi> in their Service, and offers himſelf to be <hi>preſs'd to Death,</hi> to give them a greater Pleaſure in Life. Why was the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd <hi>Noah</hi> ſo careful to prune up his <hi>Vines,</hi> but that he might leave behind him the Honour of bequeathing ſo great a Bleſſing to the World? But if hitherto that <hi>Nectar</hi> had been enviouſly detain'd from them, by the Policy or Power of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and made a <hi>Monopoly</hi> to their own <hi>Palats,</hi> ſhe will take care to break the <hi>Damm,</hi> and make it run down into every Corner of their Streets.</p>
                           <p>But then they muſt promiſe her to enjoy that Happineſs in the proper <hi>Seaſon,</hi> which would double its Pleaſures to them, and that is <hi>by Night;</hi> they would never arrive to any great Proficiency in the Noble Practice of Drinking <hi>Al-a-mode,</hi> till they <hi>muffled up day in their Curtains, and Lighted up Night with their Tapers.</hi> 'Twas a Glorious Adventure to baffle the Orders of. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to begin to <hi>Chime</hi> up their Conſorts of <hi>Muſick</hi> and <hi>Dancing,</hi> when the drowſie World lay fetter'd in the Charms of a <hi>breathing Death,</hi> and themſelves alone Alive unto Jollity and Mirth: They could never think to mount the high <hi>Flight</hi> of Pleaſure indeed, till they had tamed Nature by Watching, (as <hi>Hawks</hi> are fitted for the Game); ſhe fears they will ſlight her Advice as to this, ſince ſhe never obſerv'd a People more chain'd to their <hi>Beds,</hi> taking care with the <hi>Sibarites</hi>

                           <p>There are many other things ſhe would gladly ſee redreſſed, but ſhe is willing for the preſent to diſmiſs them, on condition they will evidence a fair Reſpect to her Counſels for the future. 'Tis true, there was one thing more ſhe would be glad to whiſper in their Ears (faining here a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick backwardneſs to diſcover it, yet ſuch as ſhe knew would but whet their deſires into long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expectation to know it, which they fancy too, above all the reſt, would help to compleat up their happineſs) but ſhe deſires to be excuſed for the preſent, till ſhe ſee to what Meaſure of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they would paſs in a dutiful Conformity to her Dictates, given out at this <hi>Meeting:</hi> And beſides, ſhe fears the diſobliging of their <hi>Wives,</hi> (whoſe company ſhe expected too, and who might equally need her Inſtruction) ſince what ſhe had further to impart, might be expounded at leaſt <hi>Miſpriſion</hi> of Treaſon againſt the <hi>Female Intereſt,</hi> and whenever ſhe reveals it, it muſt be under the ſacred Seal of <hi>Secreſie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They depart with all the Expreſſions of Joy and Satisfaction in her admired Condeſcention and obliging Nature, and aſſure her, that nothing ſhall be wanting on their part to Honour her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections by a ready Obſequiouſneſs and Reſpect, and all in an Extaſie of Raviſhing Delight, they lowly take their leave and paſs away.</p>

This takes <hi>Fire,</hi> and from a little Spark in the Boſom of One (too hot to hold there long) ſpreads into a Flame over all the City. A <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Sex</hi> is holden to debate of the matter, each one vents her private Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which blow up the reſt into a greater Fire. The fury of Jealouſie incenſes them, and they caſt about how to prevent an Evil that ſeemed to bear ſo ill a Face and Omen towards them. They univerſally Vote a <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſolve to ſtand off, and bid defiance to their Enemy. What knew they, but ſhe might bring up ſome new Laws of <hi>Divorce,</hi> and endeavour to preferr her own <hi>Drabbs of Honour</hi> into their <hi>Beds.</hi> For their parts their Spirits were as <hi>high</hi> as her Own, and they ſcorn to crouch for Advice or Directions from her. They needed none of her Imperious Impoſitions, and were Bred ſufficiently already into all the <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums</hi> of State. What can ſhe add more to them, than what they enjoyed already? Could ſhe teach them other Faſhions than what themſelves had invented? They had not ſtudied the Arts of Dreſſing ſo long, to be corrected now by a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103999:68"/>Stranger. The World was miſtaken in them, if they were not Notorious already. They thought ſhe had come to Town to have improved her ſelf rather by them, and added to her happineſs in their Company, than thus miſchievouſly to Plot againſt them. Beſides, 'twas rudely done of her, not to give them the Priority of the Invitation. They like not ſhe ſhould be ſo great with their Husbands.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Empreſs</hi> was of too ſenſible a Spirit to paſs by the Affront, without the juſt Revenge payable to it.

We are obliged to others for our Honour, and Melt away our Treaſures to purchaſe the Aire of their Mouths. Life waſts away its ſelf, and grows ungrateful with long keeping. If <hi>Abraham</hi> will be truly happy, he muſt have ſomething more than theſe. There were Princes already in the World that glittered in all the Grandeurs of State; it were a poor thing if a God ſhould put off his Favourite with the fading Flowers of a Crown: No, an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhall be contrived for him, brighter than the Sun, which ſhall diſplay its Beams as far as He, and ſhed his influences over all the Univerſe, to make it a fruitful Seminary for Heaven.

                           <p>In the former Promiſes God had affixed to him the Felicities of the Earth; but in this he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him to Himſelf, and gives him a Propriety in that bleſſing that is derived from the glorious Emanations of his very Eſſence. Indeed nothing but God himſelf can make up a perfect Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Soul. The Spirit of Man is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Subſtance, which therefore can be bleſſed in nothing but an Everlaſting God. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> The Creatures are nothing without God, but God is every thing without the Creature. 'Twas but the common Sluce of his Bounty that he had hitherto opened to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> here he ſhews him his very Heart, running out in full Streams of Love and Grace towards him, which hereafter ſhall break out and divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into all the parts of the Earth, to refreſh and rejoyce the Souls of all the Children of his Faith.

Something like this, every true Chriſtian experiences at the Firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and breaking out of Divine Light, when God firſt opens the Eyes to behold the Wonders of his Love, and ſhines in upon the Spirit in the bright Beams of his Grace; the Soul paſſes <hi>out of Darkneſs into Marvellous Light:</hi> Which affects it more than all the variety of Objects did Him at the firſt opening of his Eyes by <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This is the Muſick and Dancing at the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Father. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith pierces through ſome Thouſands of years, and ſees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the promiſed Saviour cloathed in his Fleſh, walking up and down amongſt his Children, inviting them to come and take ſhare of that Bliſs their happy Father enjoyed in Heaven: Now is he perfectly at the diſpoſal of God, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be any thing or nothing, at the good pleaſure of his Will.</p>
                           <p>Tho' Natural Engagements ſtick faſt to us, and our Hearts be cloſe Lockt up in them, and very impatiently ſuffer a Divulſion, yet ſuch are the commanding Charms of a Divine Beauty beating upon the Soul, that they eaſily Diſſolve the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments by which the Affections are bewitched to the Creatures, and procure not an Enſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103999:83"/>only but a Cordial Divorcement from them, when reflecting (with an Holy Indignation) on thoſe Diſhonourable Proſtitutions, (whileſt Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Forgetful of her ſelf) the debaſed Soul had bowed down to thoſe ſhameful Embraces.</p>

'Tis <hi>in the Night that he gives his Songs,</hi> when we are wrapped up in Reſt and ſilence.

He was wholly for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be wholly for Him; God cannot be held in a <hi>divided Heart:</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Single Eye</hi> that penetrates deepeſt into his Love, he that ſquints upon any thing elſe, ſees Him not at all.

                           <p>'Twas in the Seventy fifth Year of his Age that he paſſed out of <hi>Haran,</hi> not without the ſpecial Order of God, who now without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay leads him down by the hand into <hi>Canaan:</hi> This was that good Land which he had promiſed to ſhew him. <hi>God never diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points our hopes that are grounded on his own Word.</hi> His Eyes doubtleſs are greatly ſurprized with the pleaſing Proſpects of that goodly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Heaven will be infinitely better than what we are able to conceive of it here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; when we ſhall ſee it with our Eyes, we ſhall confeſs that half of its glory was not conveyed to our Ears. <hi>Abraham</hi> travels on, 'till he arrives at the pleaſant Plains of <hi>Moreh,</hi> adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a delightful Grove of ſtately Oaks; here he hath the honour of another Viſit from Heaven; God welcomes him into <hi>Canaan.</hi> So far is he from tiring our Faith, that he loves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it with the ſweet repaſts of his gracious Preſence; he will not give ground of ſuſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by too tedious abſence from his <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he had drawn him out of his Countrey to his loſs. <hi>God is every where preſent to the eyes of our Faith, but ſometimes more ſenſibly to the joy and rejoycing of our Heart: I will manifeſt my ſelf to him:</hi> A Mercy that <hi>the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger intermedleth not with.</hi> God never comes emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103999:88"/>handed to his Servants, but brings that with him that ſhall make up his Entertainment and Welcome; he knows that Man hath nothing worthy of Himſelf, and therefore expects no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him but an open and thankful Hand and Heart to receive his Kindneſs: <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Were our Faith ſo great and large as to comprehend the vaſt extenſions of his Bounty, we might fetch down Heaven into our boſoms: 'Tis our weakneſs and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity that puts him on feeding us (as Infants) with ſuch ſcanty drops of his Fulneſs: Our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Hearts might otherwiſe break out into thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands of raviſhing Pleaſures and Joys, which the narrowneſs of our ſpirits do now moſt unhappily deprive us of.</p>
                           <p>Thus full fraught with Bleſſings appears God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and brings down with him a <hi>Conveyance</hi> of all the Kingdoms of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him and his Heirs for ever. Indeed the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> were not to be thrown out of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion preſently, but the Eſtate ſhould be as certain to him as if It were already in hand: The poor <hi>Slaves</hi> that had it, were to be ſpared for ſome time, 'till they had dreſſed it up into a mere delightful Habitation for his Children. They had forfeited their <hi>Copies</hi> already into his hands, and he might diſpoſe of them at his own pleaſure; yet will he be ſo gracious as not too rigorouſly or haſtily to make his <hi>Entry,</hi> 'till he try whether they would ſubmit themſelves; and if not, he will yet wait for his Goodneſs ſake, and ſo ſhould <hi>Abraham</hi> for the Promiſe ſake: And though they would pay him but little <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103999:89"/>of the Love of his God to him: He raiſes up Altars, and ſends up his thankful Heart in the ſmoak of his Sacrifices: Every place where he paſſes is perfum'd with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and God ſmells the ſweet ſavour of it from above. <hi>Great is the correſpondency of the grateful Heart with Heaven.

                           <p>But does <hi>Abraham</hi> remember where he is? Is not his Zeal above his Diſcretion? The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite</hi> was yet in the Land, and what makes him thus bold to invade the Countrey, and bring in a Religion with him ſo perfectly different from all theirs? He finds them a fierce and cruel People, <hi>inflaming themſelves with their Idols.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange he did not ſmother his own in a politick Concealment, and more prudently have conſulted his ſecurity: No, but with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Undauntedneſs, great as his Heart, he dares own the Truth, and the God of it, in the Faces of them all. He charges the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in his own Quarters, and ſets up an <hi>Ark,</hi> before which he knew all the <hi>Dagons</hi> of the Countrey muſt one day fall. <hi>Fearleſneſs and Courage for God is the natural fruit of a lively Faith.

Would we keep Heaven in our Eye, and our Hopes clear and unblotted upon our Heart, we might follow him with the ſame Gallantry of Spirit through all the Territories of the Sons of the Gyant, and paſs from pleaſure to pleaſure. <hi>Faith is a prying Grace, and narrowly ſurveys the Map of the coeleſtial</hi> Canaan, <hi>to make diſcovery of thoſe joyful Manſions which our hope tells us are as ſecure to us, as if already we were in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (through Grace) by the Vertue of the ſame <hi>Covenant</hi> that God ſealed to <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                              <hi>Abraham</hi> thus aſſured of an infinite Poſterity, grows now ſollicitous and thoughtful for them, he diſcovers the nature of thoſe cares that Afflict the Boſoms of every Godly <hi>Parent.</hi> He is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that his Children may deviate from the ſteps of his own Uniform Obedience and Righteouſneſs, nor wear the ſame Livery of Grace that adorned his Loyal Spirit, and <hi>Hallowed</hi> all his Actions. His firſt Care is to enjoy a <hi>Progeny,</hi> and his next, that they might enjoy God and be Good. How rarely doth this Holy <hi>Anxiety</hi> oppreſs the Minds of Men!

Take heed, Reader, the caſe be not thine own: <hi>Sin</hi> is an <hi>Engineer in the Dark,</hi> that is ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the means of our utter Deſolation.

This is not the ordinary manner of <hi>Womens</hi> Kindneſs,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103999:130"/>who will part with every thing ſooner than the <hi>Monopoly</hi> of their Husbands <hi>Love.</hi> But <hi>Sarah's</hi> Caſe began to be deſperate, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repeated Promiſes of Children made to her <hi>Abraham,</hi> was yet never the leſs Barren than before; and it being never yet ſaid that the Heir ſhould be born of her Body, ſhe knew not but that God himſelf might inſpire her to make the <hi>Motion,</hi> and ſpeak the good Word to her <hi>Lord</hi> for <hi>Hagar;</hi> therefore ſhe contrives to lend away a piece of his Heart to her <hi>Maid,</hi> and to admit her as the ſecondary <hi>Object</hi> of his Affections, and ſhould not much repent it, if ſhe ſtill contain her ſelf within her Limits, and pay her the dutiful Reſpect owing to ſo kind a <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis diſputed whether <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Sarah,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or neither of them, ſinn'd againſt God in this Action. For Him 'tis argued, that he did it not from any Motion of Luſt, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his <hi>Wive</hi>'s Barrenneſs, had never been tempted to wander in his <hi>Affections</hi> from her, but humbly waited upon God to effect his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by thoſe means which himſelf had decreed to produce them, and had never upbraided his deareſt Wife of her <hi>Sterility,</hi> the only Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Happineſs in a Son. Nor was it contrary to the Cuſtom of <hi>Nations,</hi> and that as yet there was no Law expreſſed againſt <hi>Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Nor was he himſelf firſt in the Motion, but was led to it by the Deſire, Approbation, and Conſent of his <hi>Sarah.</hi> But above all, ſince God had told him that all the <hi>Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in his ſeed,</hi> he might poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr

The Promiſe being only to himſelf and not unto <hi>Sarah,</hi> of having ſuch Iſſue as might render it <hi>happy;</hi> he had now waited already <hi>Ten Years</hi> for the Accompliſhment of that Promiſe, and might poſſibly think himſelf obliged from the <hi>Tradition</hi> ſo common, <hi>Si Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier non pepereret intra decem Annos, tenetur ejus Maritus ad primam, ſecundam ducere <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorem,</hi> — If the Woman bear no Child within ten Years, her Husband may take a ſecond Wife to the firſt.

                           <p>For <hi>Sarah</hi> 'tis pleaded, That ſhe bore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity of her <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> with an humble reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not with that Impatiency as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did <hi>Rachel</hi> her Grand-daughter: And that ſhe thought her ſelf unworthy ſo great an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as to be the Mother of the <hi>bleſſed Seed,</hi> and did not ill at all in conſulting the Means by which ſo great a Bleſſing might be derived to Mankind; ſhe attempered her ſelf to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will,</hi> and will not envy that glory to her <hi>Hand-maid.</hi> She took it heavily that ſo great a Perſon as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be deprived of the Bleſſing of <hi>Children,</hi> and that her own Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſhould make void the Promiſes of God. See my Lord <hi>Abraham,</hi> God hath reſtrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy me from Bearing, thou vainly expecteſt <hi>Children</hi> from me; and I plainly perceive that God intends me not the Honour of making thee a joyful Father, if he did, he hath the <hi>Key of the Womb,</hi> and might eaſily heal my Barrenneſs:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103999:131"/>but ſince 'tis not his good pleaſure, I humbly ſubmit my ſelf and chearfully give way to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It matters not much whether I bear or no, but it concerns all the World that thou haſt that <hi>ſeed</hi> which muſt make it haypy: The Child of my <hi>Maid</hi> will be <hi>Mine</hi> by Law, and I ſhall embrace and <hi>Adopt</hi> it as my own. In this <hi>Glaſs</hi> we may viſibly perceive her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Love to her Husband, and beyond that, her Pious Care for all the World; and is blameable in nothing but what is common to all her Sex, a little Impatience and over-running the <hi>Decree</hi> of God, who is wiſe enough to <hi>fluſh</hi> our callow <hi>Precipitancies,</hi> and <hi>Ripen</hi> them all to <hi>flye</hi> to his Glory.

A leſs skilful <hi>Augury</hi> may ſerve to foretell the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of Wickedneſs; yet is he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly Silent, and dares not enquire into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God. <hi>'Tis ill prying into the Eſtate of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, till we find ſome ſure ground of Security to our ſelves.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> is the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> and Communication of Secrets is one of the <hi>Veins</hi> that conveys <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> to the whole Body of <hi>Friendſhip;</hi> 'tis not every one that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the <hi>Cabals</hi> of Princes. <hi>Abraham</hi> is a <hi>Favourite,</hi> and fit to be one of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> of Heaven: God that had honoured him by a Revelation of the ſecrets of his Love to himſelf, cannot keep from him the diſcovery of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Wrath on the Wicked. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall know that his God can be as <hi>Juſt</hi> as <hi>Good,</hi> and that few partak'd of the ſpecial Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that himſelf was bleſs'd in. 'Tis no ſmall Obligation that lyes upon the Faithful, from the Knowledge of their differing in Condition from the worſt of Men, only by diſtinguiſhing Mercy. <hi>What are we that thou ſhouldſt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the World. Faith grows up to a perfect Stature, by the Knowledge of every diſpenſation of God.</hi> The Prophets enforce their Doctrines from the Examples of the fierceſt Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of Vengeance. <hi>Paſs ye unto Calneh, and ſee,</hi>
                              <pb n="165" facs="tcp:103999:160"/>&amp;c. <hi>Abraham,</hi> who hereafter ſhould read Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon <hi>Sodoms</hi> Flames, to affright his Children and Family from <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Luſts, ſhall firſt hear with his <hi>Ear,</hi> and afterwards ſee with his <hi>Eye</hi> the pernicious and dreadful Deſolation that Sin had made upon them, that with greater ſence of thoſe Calamities he might terrifie others againſt the Sins that procur'd them: God knowing how powerfull Application ſo Experienc'd a <hi>Preacher</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> would ſurely make from ſuch a Text. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do,</hi> &amp;c. For I <hi>know him, that he will Command his Children and his Houſhould after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Behold the great Ordinance of <hi>Family-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Divine Inſtitution. Abraham</hi> muſt execute both Offices of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt. In vain is Obedience exacted from ſuch as know not their Duty:</hi> But in order to the means of that Knowledge, Obedience is juſtly required, and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> given by God Himſelf to enforce it. <hi>I know Abraham, that he will Command his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants,</hi> &amp;c. If the Sword or the Word be too precarious, look for Confuſion and Ignorance to prevail over all. <hi>Abraham</hi> is inveſted with a perfect Power to ſubject them to the Diſcipline of God: He was Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign over his Family, and God is ſo far from <hi>Clipping</hi> his Authority, that he gives him the <hi>Broad Seal of Heaven</hi> to confirm his Commiſſion. He had Power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> within his own <hi>Houſe;</hi> they were not worthy to live, ſhould they not learn the ſaving Knowledge of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commandments; to little purpoſe were they

                              <hi>Circumciſed in the Fleſh,</hi> if they be not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Knowledge of that Sacrament, nor how far it oblig'd them to Obedience and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>But I know Abraham that he will teach them,</hi> &amp;c. Even this Great <hi>Prince</hi> will not think it beneath him to <hi>Catechiſe</hi> the meaneſt <hi>Herdsman</hi> in his Family: 'Tis the Work of God, an <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hath an Heart to it; 'tis a Glorious work, the Saving of Souls, and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it: 'Tis tranſmitting Piety to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Child unborn will praiſe God for <hi>Abraham:</hi> 'Tis the advancing the Intereſt and Glory of God upon Earth, which never faileth to bring to Glory in Heaven.</p>
                           <p>See the decay of Religion, and weep tears of Blood: Where lives the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that improves his Authority in his <hi>Family</hi> for God, and the <hi>Souls</hi> he hath made (unleſs in a cold and perfunctory manner?)

                           <p>'Twas becauſe of this <hi>Fidelity</hi> that the Great <hi>Abraham</hi> was admitted into the Secrets of his <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt <hi>Sodom:</hi> The clamour of whoſe Provocations would ſuffer divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear them no longer. God could not be in Quiet for them in Heaven; either they muſt ceaſe to be thus wicked, or to have any further <hi>Being</hi> in the World; <hi>He will eaſe himſelf of theſe Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> they ſhall no longer oppreſs his Patience, or abuſe his Goodneſs. His <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> had run out to the utmoſt Extremity. He is now ready for <hi>vengeance,</hi> they ripe for <hi>deſtruction.</hi> When the whole World ſhall be <hi>white unto the great Harveſt,</hi> Then ſhall the <hi>Sickle</hi> of Ruine cut it down: Yet ſhall not Execution be done upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> before all the Formalities of Judgment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede; <hi>Proceſs</hi> and <hi>Enquiry</hi> ſhall be made into the Merits of their Cauſe.

                           <p>Now is <hi>Abraham</hi> left with the Lord alone; and 'tis remarkable, that himſelf, who had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed

                              <hi>Abraham</hi> receives not the News of <hi>Sodom's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction with any pleaſure at all.

There is a <hi>City</hi> will know this one day, that hath made ſo many <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> and kindled ſo many <hi>Flames</hi> upon the Bodies of the Saints. <hi>Abraham</hi> prepares to <hi>Plead</hi> as Fiercely as he had <hi>Fought</hi> for <hi>Sodom</hi> before. How ſerviceable are the Favourites to the Enemies of God, who yet hate and perſecute them. Down he falls, and on the bare <hi>Knees</hi> of his very <hi>Soul</hi> Beggs, That God would maintain the Honour of his own <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and that the <hi>Righteous</hi> might not taſte of the bitter Cup of the <hi>Wicked:</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (If it would pleaſe him) that the <hi>Wicked</hi> might live for the <hi>Righteous</hi> ſake, and the <hi>Righteous</hi> for their own.

I need not tell thee that I Sacrifice all my Worldly Joys, yea, and my Self in thee; But God muſt be obeyed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art thou too Dear for him that calls thee.

                           <p>And now is <hi>Abraham</hi> as pleaſed with a <hi>Grave,</hi> as ever was Prince of a <hi>Palace:</hi> How many Mens <hi>Eſtates</hi> are their <hi>Graves</hi> while they live, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of another.

                           <p>'Tis obſervable, That after <hi>Sarahs</hi> Death, God makes no more Appearances to <hi>Abraham</hi> from Heaven, having now performed the Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a <hi>Seed,</hi> he leaves him to walk in the Light and Comfort of thoſe he had already made: To teach us that the Great <hi>Heir</hi> being now come into the World (in whoſe coming all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are perfectly ſecure to the Faithful) the Church is not to expect any Extraordinary <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of any farther <hi>Truths</hi> than what he hath already ſent into the World by his <hi>Son.</hi> He hath now ſealed up the whole <hi>Canon,</hi> and will hereafter be ſilent for ever. To theſe received, we ought to truſt, in the Hope of theſe we ought to Live, in the Comfort of theſe we ought to dye.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103999:190"/>Practice of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Holy Son of ſo Bleſſed a <hi>Father,</hi> whoſe Soul was ever filled with God. What a lovely Draught of his Devotion hath the Divine Pencil preſented to our Eye. <hi>Iſaac went out to meditate in the Fields in the Evening. Meditation</hi> is the Souls pitching on ſome Branch of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> where it ſits viewing its own <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and chirping out Praiſes to God the <hi>Author</hi> of it. Next to <hi>Abraham,</hi> no Man living had a more pleaſant Proſpect of ſweeter Objects than <hi>Iſaac</hi> to contemplate. Heaven and Earth was but one Field for his unlimited Soul to walk in: From the lower <hi>Terraces</hi> here in the World (without the help of his Sons Ladder) might he mount up to the the <hi>Turrets</hi> above, and Feaſt his Eyes with the Glories of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> He was equally Heir of both <hi>Canaan</hi>'s, confirm'd to him by the very Oath of God. Could he want Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject then for holy Meditation, or Praiſe, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Matter for his buſie Thoughts to work on? <hi>Thoughts</hi> are the Iſſues of the Mind, that Prolifick <hi>Parent,</hi> whoſe <hi>Children</hi> are all of one Nature with it ſelf, and never differ in Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from it: If that be <hi>Terreſtrial,</hi> ſo are They; but if Holy, they cannot be <hi>unclean,</hi> and ſhould they prove ſo, they are with <hi>Iſhmael</hi> caſt out: There is no lodging for them in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
                           <p>Behold <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Pious Exerciſe (like an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Cuſtom</hi>) grown quite out of Uſe: The Defection of the Old World come upon us. <hi>All the Imaginations of the Heart</hi> (for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Men) <hi>evil, and only evil, and that continually: God is not in all their thoughts.</hi> He by

Hath God ſpread all the Treaſures of his unſearchable Grace, and laid them before him, to make his own Choice, and to take them all to himſelf? Is <hi>this price in his hand</hi> to be happy for ever, and hath <hi>the Fool no heart to it?</hi> Is the Everlaſting <hi>Charter</hi> fairly Copied out, and ſent him down from above to peruſe and read over, wherein he finds all the Priviledges of Heaven and Earth made over and ſecured to him, and all this not worthy reflecting on: And the <hi>Book</hi> lying as faſt claſped up as his own <hi>Heart?</hi> See how grievouſly God takes this Affront to his Goodneſs. <hi>I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing:</hi> A matter not concerning them at all.

Thy Soul is departed from God, and <hi>God</hi> (as from <hi>Saul) is departed from thee, and what wilt thou do in the end thereof?</hi> On what will thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Thoughts feed on to Eternity? 'Twere a Judgment to paſs one day without <hi>Meditation</hi> on God! but how wilt thou ſpend an endleſs Life without him? which yet thou canſt not do, while all thy Faculties will be enlarg'd to take in nought but Plagues and Torments, which here fed on nothing but Vanity and <hi>Leaſing:</hi> There thou wilt do nothing elſe but think on His Wrath on thy Self and Others, who here hadſt no leiſure or Heart to think on his Love and Goodneſs to thy Self and Others. Bethink thy ſelf a little, while thou art in the World, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon up thy Conſiderative <hi>Faculties,</hi> ſet them all at work to ruminate on the unchangeable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wherein thou wilt either Praiſe or Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Name of God for ever: Haſt thou a Soul given thee for no other Work but to compleat thine own Miſery? And doth God wait upon thee but until thou <hi>fitteſt thy Self for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> whiles thou art little thinking how ſoon it will come upon thee? And then all the <hi>vain Thoughts that lodge within thee,</hi> will take their
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103999:192"/>flight from thee, and periſh for ever with thee: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, conſider thy wayes.</hi> And remember, 'tis the proper work of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul</hi> (and of no other Creature but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) to reflect on it ſelf, and wiſely to project for its future Happineſs. When God hath laid before thee all the Contrivances of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Councels and Love towards thee in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>ſet Him forth to be a Propitiation thrô Faith in his Blood,</hi> that thine Eyes and Heart may be aſtoniſhed with Admiration of ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: That this <hi>White Flag</hi> ſhould hang up ſo long, and none conſider the <hi>Black</hi> One of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may appear in its ſtead; when all hopes of Life are gone and departed for ever: This is an Evidence of a fatal Obduration, and a mighty Contempt of Divine Grace. See Sinner! Mercy is yet offer'd! <hi>Propoſals</hi> of Peace are laid before thee! Conſider, thy Life and Soul are in hazard; if thou art drawing lines with <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> in the <hi>Dust,</hi> while the City is ſtormed, and the Enemy entred, the next News will be the Sword in thy Bowels, and an everlaſting <hi>Adieu</hi> to thy preſumptuous Hopes.</p>
                           <p>But while <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s holy Heart was better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and he was ſweetly walking with his God in the Fields, his Eyes diſcover the <hi>Camels</hi> Coming. <hi>In the doing thy Commandments there is great Reward: Mercy</hi> overtakes him in the midſt of <hi>Duty.</hi> In the very Moment that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, God gives him the Enjoyment of his <hi>Rebekah,</hi> to whom (for the Honour that ſhe doth him in lighting off her <hi>Came<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>l,</hi> and Veyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf at the firſt Meeting) he pays ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

Since <hi>Eternity</hi> was <hi>Retail'd</hi> into <hi>Parcels</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Dayes,</hi> never was there a <hi>Century</hi> better paſs'd in Univerſal Obedience to the Glory of the God of Life, whoſe Divine Wiſdom thinks it but juſt to ſend him a <hi>Writ of Eaſe</hi> from all his <hi>Travels under the Sun;</hi> and having finiſhed the Work he had given him to do, to call for him Home, and to fix him in his Lodgings with Himſelf in the Unmoveable Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Abraham is dead, and the Prophets:</hi> They have <hi>chalked</hi> out to us the <hi>Path of Life,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to Heaven. With what Impudence can any Church tell me, That if I <hi>follow the Steps</hi> of the Great <hi>Abraham,</hi> believe and <hi>Live</hi> as He; yet ſhall I never Arrive to his Boſom, unleſs I ſeal to the Articles of their own deviſing, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103999:194"/>believe what <hi>Abrahams</hi> Holy Heart would have <hi>Riſen at,</hi> and Abhorr'd to conſent to? Should God ſend again this holy <hi>Saint</hi> from Heaven to walk a while among his Children on Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſtill but his own <hi>Principles,</hi> and teaching them to others, as what were ſufficient to bring them to Happineſs, in a Zealous Rejection of all the vain Inventions of Men, impoſed now on the <hi>Christian</hi> World, under the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s of Death; confident I am, even <hi>Abraham</hi> would very hardly eſcape the Cenſures of the Curſed <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which <hi>Wracks</hi> the Faith of every Soul (within its Clutches) into larger Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of impoſſible things to be Credited, than the Tortured Joynts are drawn out to under the cruel <hi>Twitches</hi> of the Tyrannical <hi>Engine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If Revelation of Divine <hi>Truth,</hi> imprinted on the Heart (fitted and ſoftned to receive the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon it,) and gaining upon the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to embrace and delight in it, working off the Life from unſuitable Practices, to reduce it into a <hi>Natural</hi> and pleaſing Conformity to the Holy Rule, be not enough to ſecure me from the Dangers of Error and <hi>Deluſion,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Superſtitious</hi> World ſo uncharitably charges every Diſſenter from its Follies, (ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably impoſed,) let me contentedly dye, and put it to the Tryal before the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of the Great <hi>Judge;</hi> who I am ſure cannot deny his own Work, in Attempering an Heart to his Holy Knowledge and Obedience, that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſo Averſe and Rebellious againſt both: And for <hi>Appendices</hi> to Religion, Policies of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and offenſive <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> &amp;c. I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103999:194"/>diſtinguiſh (in the Light of Truth) how far I am obliged to conform to them for the ſake of Peace and Honour of the Church; and in the ſame Light to differ from them, where they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Truth, and grate too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſcience; and yet ſtill 'tis my Duty to pay Reſpect (ſo far as I can) to the Perſons of Men: Thô I know it mine Intereſt in no wiſe to bend to their Principles, or cloſe in with them in Cringing to a falſe God; and this I learn from <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe Demeanour towards the Children of <hi>Heth</hi> was full of Condeſcention and Civil Reſpect, while he would have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to <hi>Dye,</hi> rather than given them the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Preſence in their <hi>Idolatrous Temples.</hi> Civility and an Endearing Carriage hath its huge Advantages in the World, where Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedneſs and a Moroſe look is not only ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel, but affrighting. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had been a Perſon of a Rugged Supercilious <hi>Deportment</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, how dimly had his Light ſhined in the Diverſity of Nations, where God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to go! how little had his Profeſſion profited towards an embracing of the Truths he followed! I think it may be truly Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, That the Generous and obliging Spirits of ſome Gentlemen in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, have done more to allure the Minds of our unſtable Neighbours, to harbour good Thoughts of their ill Religion, than all the deſigning At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of their Prieſts, whoſe Cloyſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103999:195"/>them rather to ſtand upon their Guard againſt them, than to receive them in open Arms of Love: And while very few of that <hi>Fraternity</hi> can give a rational Account of at leaſt <hi>Two</hi> parts in <hi>Three</hi> of their Faith, which they ever devolve upon the Church, (who takes care too that a prying Inſpection be ever diſcouraged and <hi>Brow beaten</hi>) it ſhall ſuffice me to walk in the luſtre of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Religion, from whom the Reformed Churches have received the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; and care not to follow any other: And for my Self, had I a thouſand Souls to Anſwer for, I would adventure them all upon the pure and unſpotted Profeſſion of Him, who had all his Knowledge from God ſanctified into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Life, which fitted him in the End for a Glorious Death, and a bleſſed Eternity.</p>
